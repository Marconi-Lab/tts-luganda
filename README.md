# 🗣️ Luganda-TTS

This project presents a Luganda Text-to-Speech (TTS) system built using the [VITS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06103) architecture for end-to-end speech synthesis.

## 🔍 Overview

- Fine-tuned a VITS model using **2.8 hours of proprietary, professionally recorded Luganda speech** from a female speaker.
- The base model was pretrained on **female Luganda speech** from Mozilla's [Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/lg/datasets).
- Compare the output of different model checkpoints interactively via our [GitHub Pages demo](https://Marconi-Lab.github.io/tts-luganda/).
